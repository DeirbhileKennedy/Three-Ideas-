THREE IDEAS
============


Explore your forest
---------------------
###Overview

Children now always seem to me addicted to their phones/ipads etc. constantly being online and not leaving the house as much as kids back in the day.  Smart devices our in children’s lives and they are here to stay. Although technology can create many opportunities for more engaged learning, why not create an app to combine this online learning but get children out of the house to engage with the environment and learn new things. 

This new engaging app is a way to get kids to have fun while exploring the outside, allowing them to socialise together and get them talking but at the same time learn new things about the outside world in their local forests or parks. 

###Pros 

+There are young children in my family so I will not be short of ways to test this idea. 
+This will be a great way to get children to socialise and explore.
+This will provide a source of educational entertainment for children.
+Children have access to endless amounts of technology to be able to use this. 
+It can help me increase my prototyping skills 

###Cons

+Is there enough people that would want/ be interested in using something like this?
+I have no experience In kid based apps so I will have to do plenty of research to ensure it is engaging enough. 

###How might this be built?

This idea could be prototyped using XD or Figma. This would be an effective way to show the details and movement between screens and an idea of how the app would work. 

###Whose it for?

The target audience for this would be:
1.	Parents with children under the age of 4, this could a learning tool for the parents to use to teach their child while out for walks etc.
2.	Also children aged 5-9 who have the understanding of using phones or tablets they can go off on their own while out in walks playing the game but also learning. 

###What is the business model?

I am unsure if this app would be completely free or have a freemium aspect to it.  By removing the payment barrier this will increase the likelihood that users in my target market will download and try it. 
However users could download this app to begin with and throughout the usage be offered in-app purchases which from an educational point of few I can see parents buying into as this could maybe offer additional content.

Family organisation
-------------------
###Overview

Feel like you’re the only one in the house always doing chores while others get away with doing nothing? Yes that is exactly how I feel sometimes coming from a large family. Why not bring the “whose doing the chores schedule and rewards “ sheet online where reminders and notifications can be sent to family members of what there is to do. 

This application could be a way for parents and families manage everyday activities such as chores, family calendars, rewards, goals and so much more.  It would provide an easy way to manage kids’ chores and allowances.
This idea could be gamified giving kids a goal to reach but also as a game by gaining points etc. Motivation is a key way of getting kids to do stuff therefore it wont be just left to one person in the family. 

###Pros

+Coming from a large family myself this idea could be trailed and tested on my own. 
+Having not created an app before this could be a new skill I could begin to learn, also it can enhance and increase the skills of HTML that I already have. 
+Can get families working together. 

###Cons 

+Could be too detailed and have too many concepts to it that it might not work out.
+App out there that are similar so how could I make mine different and successful? 
+I have never created an app before therefore could be a challenge.

###How might this be built?

I think this idea would work best as an app. I also like the idea of being able to connect with things such as apple watches and amazon echos/google homes. 

###Whose it for? 

The target audience would be a range of different people.  The idea would be for it to help families stay more organised but it could also work in work places, classrooms etc.

###What is the business model?

I feel like families would pay for this service. The users can pay once to download this app and use all of its functionality.  This resonates with users who prefer to pay once to get the full app experience, without in-app purchases. However I feel like I would need to research this more.
